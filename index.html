                        I was exceptionally pleased with Rene. He upgraded my electrical service for less than I was
                        quoted by 2 other electricians. The service was speedy and professional.

                    <p>
                        We needed 17 recessed lights installed in our kitchen, living room,
                        dining room and foyer as well as an electric outlet and coaxial drop
                        being relocated for TV wall mount.
                        When Rene arrived, he looked over each area
                        and gave us a good overview of what type of lighting would work,
                        where it would best be placed and how much lighting would be ideal.
                        Rene created a proposal that broke down the work
                        to be done and the total cost of each area or room in the house.
                        That way, all we had to do was pick and choose what solutions/options worked best for us.

                        When it came to installation,
                        he arrived on time
                        and made a seriously conscious effort
                        to avoid putting holes in the ceiling when finalizing the grid/layout.
                        He did the job quickly, cleanly and with expertise.
