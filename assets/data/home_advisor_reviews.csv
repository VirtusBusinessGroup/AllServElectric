I got a new house and there was electricity only on half of the house. Rene explained the situation very clearly and provided different solutions, the work was done very professionally and his team was very nice and careful with my stuff. They did an excellent job and the quality of their work is awesome, I will hire them once I start remodeling no doubt!"
5.0,Alicia G.,"Westminster, CA",2024-08-27,"Install Electrical Switches, Outlets, or Fixtures","I would definitely recommend All Services Electrical. They are very knowledgeable and thorough in their work. Nothing got overlooked! They were very professional and clean. They installed some fans, some light fixtures and fixed sone electrical outlets that were not working properly. I am very happy with the work they did.  If I could give them more than 5 stars I would give them more. Excellent job!!"

5.0,Sylvia C.,"Colton, CA",2024-05-01,"Install Electrical Switches, Outlets, or Fixtures","Rene did some work on my home when I lived in Culver City.  I bought a fixer upper in Moreno Valley and I called him.  At first he said no but then reconsidered and came to help me out.  He replaced some bad wiring, installed a couple of fans, and installed the microwave over the stove.  That was all he had time for.  He gave me suggestions on what else could and should be done as well as pricing range so I wouldn't be price gouged.  I am more than pleased with the quality and professionalism of his work.  I recommend him 100%."

5.0,Alicia G.,"Westminster, CA",2024-05-01,Install Electrical for a Home Addition or Remodel,"Rene is a true professional. I recommend him and his crew hands down. He answered all my questions and gave me a fast estimate. There were no surprises because they did what was convened at the price agreed. They repaired some outages, and installed some light fixtures. I love that they arrived on time, did an amazing job for a fair price, and cleaned up more than expected. He exceeded my expectations because he went above and beyond. He is very charismatic and knowledgeable. I would definitely hire him again and recommend to friends and family."

5.0,Susan G.,"Santa Monica, CA",2015-03-14,Install a Ceiling Fan,"Very happy with the installation and Rene successfully patched the ceiling cuts to match my existing venetian plaster. Nice guys, too."
5.0,Richard S.,"Lomita, CA",2015-03-13,Install a Bath Exhaust Fan,"Rene is very personable, knowledgeable and cares about your house as well as his workmanship. Our initial contact, he had more questions for me, than I had for him and I was pleasantly surprised; he was very detailed and he wanted to understand the whole picture, which shows he really cares. And Rene and Bob did the best clean up job I&apos;ve ever seen. We hope to have Rene do some more electrical work in the future."
5.0,Toti G.,"Cypress, CA",2015-03-08,Install Electrical for a Home Addition or Remodel,"Remodeled home and upgraded wiring in old part of house to match the remodeled part. It was a big job, but Rene did truly elegant and effective work. He cleaned up after himself and the previous electricians&apos; old work. My wiring was a mess before, but NOT any more!!! I am super happy with the work, the products installed, and above all, with Rene himself. If crazy electrical things came out of my walls, Rene would show me, offer me solutions, give me pricing estimates, and fix it--either per my request or better when possible. Will definitely call on him again for future projects. Totally recommend him to all my friends. Call him; you&apos;ll be glad you did."
