5.0,Gerardo A.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",8/27/2024,"Install Electrical Switches, Outlets, or Fixtures","They were great from start to finish! I got a new house and there was electricity only on half of the house. Rene explained the situation very clearly and provided different solutions, the work was done very professionally and his team was very nice and careful with my stuff. They did an excellent job and the quality of their work is awesome, I will hire them once I start remodeling no doubt!"
5.0,Alicia G.,"Westminster, CA",8/27/2024,"Install Electrical Switches, Outlets, or Fixtures","I would definitely recommend All Services Electrical. They are very knowledgeable and thorough in their work. Nothing got overlooked! They were very professional and clean. They installed some fans, some light fixtures and fixed sone electrical outlets that were not working properly. I am very happy with the work they did.  If I could give them more than 5 stars I would give them more. Excellent job!!"

5.0,Sylvia C.,"Colton, CA",5/1/2024,"Install Electrical Switches, Outlets, or Fixtures","Rene did some work on my home when I lived in Culver City.  I bought a fixer upper in Moreno Valley and I called him.  At first he said no but then reconsidered and came to help me out.  He replaced some bad wiring, installed a couple of fans, and installed the microwave over the stove.  That was all he had time for.  He gave me suggestions on what else could and should be done as well as pricing range so I wouldn't be price gouged.  I am more than pleased with the quality and professionalism of his work.  I recommend him 100%."
5.0,Anonymous,"Pasadena, CA",5/1/2024,Upgrade an Electrical Panel,"I had such an amazing and smooth experience while contracting Rene Gastelum with All Services Electrical. My friend recommended this company and I?m glad I chose to follow through. Rene arrived on time, excellent quality work. Rene?s expertise and clear communication regarding the issue and the necessary steps for resolution instilled confidence in the quality of their work. Rene Gastelum was courteous, respectful of my home and ensured the work area was left clean and tidy after completing the job. This level of consideration for the customer's space added to the overall positive experience. All Services Electrical great company to work with! Also Thank You Rene for your kindness towards our pets. Definitely will refer this company to family and friends."
5.0,Alicia G.,"Westminster, CA",5/1/2024,Install Electrical for a Home Addition or Remodel,"Rene is a true professional. I recommend him and his crew hands down. He answered all my questions and gave me a fast estimate. There were no surprises because they did what was convened at the price agreed. They repaired some outages, and installed some light fixtures. I love that they arrived on time, did an amazing job for a fair price, and cleaned up more than expected. He exceeded my expectations because he went above and beyond. He is very charismatic and knowledgeable. I would definitely hire him again and recommend to friends and family."
